# hello-world
Doing the "Hello World" tutorial as an pre-class activity in a data science course at TERA

Now I must write a little about myself. 
I'm not an IT person by formation, I have a background on industrial engineering with an specific focus at quality/six sigma and management/operational excellence.
This knowledge ended up on projects involving KPI management, and this naturally has intersections with Business Intelligence, where I started my journey technology per se.
Years past, I'm now a skilled data analyst looking to further learn towards the data science path and go even deeper in the IT side of things. I'm doing this course at TERA, a brazillian edtech startup, to facilitate my journey on this field.

And learning GIT and GitHub is part of the journey :P
